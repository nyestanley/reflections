When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You should use a remote repository when you are working from different computers on a project or there are multiple people working on the same branch from different locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working a branch that will be a feature or extension of the main code base ou might want to frequently pull the latest version of the base to make sure your "new" code will not introduce any bugs. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit of tracking the last known stats of the remote is so that that local commits are tracked and managed easier and debugging is easier also.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
If Git and GitHiub were not available to me I would use some other form of version-control. It would still be easy to track changes and work off different branches but it will become more cumbersome during code-reviews.
