When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You should use a remote repository when you are working from different computers on a project or there are multiple people working on the same branch from different locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working a branch that will be a feature or extension of the main code base ou might want to frequently pull the latest version of the
base to make sure your "new" code will not introduce any bugs.
